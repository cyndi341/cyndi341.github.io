        Hello All!  My name is Cynthia Jennings, but I go by Cyndi.  I live in Central Missouri and work at the University of Missouri at the Animal Science Research Center where Iâ€™ve been the Building Coordinator for 17 years.  I have two children; Zane is a senior in high school, and Gwyn will return to MU in the fall to continue working on her BS in Social Work.  I have been married for 24 years to Steve.  I do not have any previous web experience, but I have always wanted to learn how to code.  I am looking forward to this class and expect to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. I would like to take my new skills into the next course to learn even more.  In my spare time I enjoy reading and my favorite hobby is quilting.
