        Hello All!  My name is Cynthia Jennings, but I go by Cyndi.  I live in Central Missouri with my husband Steve and two children, Gwyn and Zane.  Gwyn is a sophomore at MU and Zane is a senior in high school.  I work at the University of Missouri at the Animal Science Research Center where I have been the Building Coordinator for 17 years.  I do not have any previous web coding experience, but I have always wanted to take a class like this.  I expect to learn the basics of HTML and CSS and would like to take my new skills into the next course to learn even more.  I am roughly mid-way through the masters in Learning Technologies with Online Education emphasis.  In my spare time I enjoy reading and my favorite hobby is quilting.
