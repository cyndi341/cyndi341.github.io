            <h3>Career &amp; Life Reflection</h3>
       
        <p>I have been very fortunate that for the most part, the various jobs I have held since graduating from college have been focused around the agricultural industry. In hindsight my degree in general agriculture taught me a great many things but ultimately, I learned a large portion of what I use today while outside the classroom and from the many years of practical experience. I will touch on a few of my qualities that make me a valuable employee.</p>

        <p>Hard work is the best work. This is something that came to me very early growing up on a small farm in mid Missouri. As a young person I had chores that were about getting dirty and sweaty, being completely worn out at the end of the day and getting up to do it all over again the next day. Picking up sticks in a field that seemed to go on forever and cleaning out a farrowing house so that the next round of sows could go in to have their piglets were just a few of the jobs that were part of my life as a kid. At a very young age I learned the meaning of a hard day’s work and I believe that is why I have never shied away from manual labor when the need arises nor will I ever ask someone to do something I would not be willing to do myself. I do not have to do this type of work very often anymore, but this instilled in me a work ethic and pride in my work regardless if it is manual labor or office work sitting at a desk.</p>

        <p>Communication is key. I had to learn this little tidbit the hard way and because of that it left a very strong impression that I carry with me daily. During a job in college I had a lack of communication with a supervisor and it ultimately cost me a job I really liked. Although this was not my career but simply a job I had while getting my degree the experience could have been avoided by having a clean and healthy line of communication with my supervisor. I look back on that lesson in life and use it while communicating with everyone around me whether they are my subordinates, my equals or my superiors. It is for this reason that I will always try to make my communication both verbally and in writing as clear and concise as possible. This goes hand in hand with building a network of people around me that know that what I say is a relection of who I am and what type of person I endeavor to be.</p>

        <p>Never stop learning. I could easily think that I have nothing left to learn but that simply is not how I want to live my life. I want to keep learning and growing whether that be professionally or in my personal life. From watching a YouTube video that shows me something new in Microsoft Excel to taking a master’s level class in HTML and CSS, learning new things makes for a fulfilling life. I endeavor to be a lifelong learner of things that help me succeed as an employee, as a mother, as a wife and as a human. When my mother started having health issues, I knew that I could be on the same path if I did not make some changes to my lifestyle. I did research to see what could help me and it is for this reason that I am down thirty pounds, take no medications and feel better than I have in many years. Taking the initiative to educate myself instead of going with what was easy is a valuable lesson that I will not soon forget and that I will apply to every aspect of my life.</p>

        <p>Finally, I will use a quote from Albert Einstein “The measure of intelligence is the ability to change” to express one of my favorite redeeming qualities. I believe that the ability to adapt as circumstances change and the world changes around us is a vital skill. Of course, as individuals, we must know when to take a stand for something we truly believe in, but when we are faced with changes beyond our control we must be willing to adapt or find ourselves very unhappy. I believe this attribute also goes with my willingness to admit when I am wrong or have made a mistake and the ability to graciously accept criticism. I am human. I make mistakes, I own them, and I learn from them.
