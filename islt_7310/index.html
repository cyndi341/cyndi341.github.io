    <h4>A Little About Me
        </h4>

    <p>My name is Cynthia Jennings, but I go by Cyndi. Currently, I serve as the Senior Support Business Specialist and Building Coordinator for the Animal Sciences Research Center on the University of Missouri Campus. In this roll I deal with the day to day operations of a teaching and animal research facility. This entails working with a multitude of different campus departments and outside vendors to ensure the smooth operation of this multidisciplinary building.
        <br>
    <br> I believe that hard work and determination are two of my key attributes as well as my ability to work with a wide range of different ethnic groups and educational backgrounds. Outside of work I enjoy being with my husband of 24 years, our two kids, and our array of furry household members. When not taking classes as part of my master’s program I use my free time for quilting or reading.
